# Red Thread Theory

_A modern 3D-experience using R3F Atmosphere_

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is built with React + Vite + react-three-fiber (R3F) and showcases an interactive environment utilizing the Atmosphere system.  
I cloned from a base project and reworked it, bringing in custom visualizations, user-interaction flows, and a minimal, modern aesthetic aligned with the design direction.
